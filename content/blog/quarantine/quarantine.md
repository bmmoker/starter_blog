*millions of people same situation*

## Reflections

My work closed 3/18 to the public. We made the announcement about a week prior that we would go remote. Quarantine has been an interesting time. I for one will never complain about having to work remote for several months but the reality of not being able to go outside nearly as often hurts. Not that under normal circumstances I would go outside as often as I currently yearn to. One of those options that's nice to know I had. Weather was luckily playing nice with rain and below 50 for the majority.

The adjustment period was slow to say the least. In the back of my mind, being locked inside should have spurred a self development stage where all I can check off a lot of my To Do list. That didn't happen. First 3 weeks were just slow. And I mean slow, I don't know if I ended up doing anything productive. The goal was to get my fill of the instant gratifications that I've been postponing, aka video games. Trying to find the motivation to move beyond was...well trying. And then I read Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson.
