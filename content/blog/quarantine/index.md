## Reflections

My work closed 3/18 to the public. We made the announcement about a week prior that we would go remote. Quarantine has been an interesting time. I for one will never complain about having to work remote for several months but the reality of not being able to go outside nearly as often hurts. Not that under normal circumstances I would go outside as often as I currently yearn to. One of those options that's nice to know I had. Weather was luckily playing nice with rain and below 50 for the majority.

The adjustment period was slow to say the least. In the back of my mind, being locked inside should have spurred a self development stage where all I can check off a lot of my To Do list. That didn't happen. First 3 weeks were just slow. And I mean slow, I don't know if I ended up doing anything productive. The goal was to get my fill of the instant gratifications that I've been postponing, aka video games. Trying to find the motivation to move beyond was...well trying. And then I read Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson.

## Books

### Steve Jobs

What a book. It took me on a whirlwind I was not expecting to go. 6 weeks out and I already have been yearning to read it again. Unfortunately I let my brother-in-law borrow it so I must wait. But what a read. There was a lot of clarification about how things happened and the order in which they did. Being historically oriented, I enjoyed that aspect. The writing was flowing and increasing pace as I turned each page. Then there came the iPod.

What a time it was. Not only when I received my first iPod but also reliving that moment. The turn that I was not expecting to take with the book. Nostalgia ripped me through the pages and put me there back scene as I read how it came to be. Every step of the way the features that I used. The digital hub and how it ran my life from 2005-2010. What a time. A newfound appreciation for a forgotten soul. I almost tried digging up my old nano and seeing what was on it. Then I remembered it was my sister's music.

But in the end what it reaffirmed is the sarcastic stance that people take with Apple in a mocking manner. They're so expensive. Are really getting more? Yes. And the book highlights it through and through. What goes into an Apple product is not the same as what goes into a Windows machine. Does it make it better? That's not my decision to make. But it's the complete package, blending 2 worlds: technical and aesthetic, together seamlessly. It's awe-inspiring.

### The Pioneers

I guess all this time indoors has given me the time to read all the things I didn't read when I should of. And by that I mean I bought a new book about the Pioneers. David McCollough, so you know it's good stuff. I was motivated by it being one of his more recent books and about a time period I wasn't too familiar with. It did not disappoint. The early times in Ohio were tough. I would not want to be there, but it was also so critical that the territory was established. It's peak only lasted about 15-20 years until the focus moved to further west.

### The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F***

This one was a reread, I will admit it. Sometimes I do give an occasional one to many. And this counterintuitive approach was a nice spin on taking a step back and reigning it in. A quick and easy read that I forsee myself reading again. I am currently realizing some of the motifs highlighted bluntly in this book more subtly in others(see below). Ideas of struggle and self as the way forward. Struggle a little more be your self (2 words) a little less. And then of course you die.

### Autobiography of a Yogi

I'll admit it. Steve Jobs read it, so will I.
