## TL;DR

I'm a generalist, interested in the variety. Here's how the site came to be from introduction to dabbling to procrastinating and finally back to dabbling but full time. Learns "It's ok"

## The Beginning

Starting my own site was always a long vision but naturally, I never knew what to use the site for. That was the hardest question to answer for many years. For a while I toiled with learning HTML/CSS and PHP trying to create something that didn't look like it was born in '95. My first introduction was to Drupal and that worked great while I was using it in a classroom setting. But then I put it down for a few months and it ceased to perform. I then was forced to learn ColdFusion as it was on it's last legs. ColdFusion and PHP; fun, new, budding technologies.

This struggle went on for a while although finding new tools such as Sublime Text and for a while, Dreamweaver, reinvigorated my interests. I found things too cumbersome. With a lack of passion towards any meaningful content development. The project was shelved.

Looking back, these were times where I am still thankful for as I picked up some fundamentals that I can still return to today. By the time I left college I had learned intros to some older but stable languages, choosing to take a course in Java and VB. Although I could manage in those classes, life as a full time programmer didn't seem like a job for me no matter how much I flirted with the idea.

I decided to learn more about different use cases by starting my career at a service desk. Here I would learn the invaluable skill of troubleshooting. A deterrent to most people, I find solice. There's a simple something about fixing things. Maybe it's the delayed gratification. 

## The Middle

Then there was a lull, from the web development interest. Working in tech support opened my eyes to various interests from hardware to networking to security and most in-between. I tried to dabble in most, never settling on one due to an unfocused curiosity. In this time, I was able to get an MBA, concentrating in Business Intelligence. Business Intelligence, adding to the growing list of curiosities, opened yet another avenue of opportunity. I dabbled but was never quite able to solidify deep understandings of intermediary concepts that would have propelled me to further insight. 

That left me looking for the next cool thing, interested in learning more. And that's when things came full circle. Started contemplating kicking the tires on a website, but first I needed a refresher. My curiosity led me to knowing that I didn't want to use the Drupal or the Wordpress. If I was going to do this (even with little subject experience), I was going to understand it all. Naturally this started with a server.

As always, there was a brief introduction to developing a web server in/right after undergrad. So that is where I started. After contemplating building a real server I quickly acknowledged that physical wasn't the path. Everyone no is moving serverless and hosting on Amazon. It was around this time I started talking to a coworker about Digital Ocean, a solution I had stumbled upon but knew nothing about. Just my luck, he happened to be using it for hosting his sites. Problem solved, I use Digital Ocean to build the server and I can play around with the configuration. 

And that's what I did. I found some instructions to help me set it up with Ghost and Nginx. The Nginx part was fun as I recall, trying to understand the configuration. Ghost was straightforward and gave you a CMS which I installed. And then I was there. Where I had been so many times before, staring at a CMS and needing to come up with content while simultaneously limiting my scope to what the CMS offered. 
*I don't have too much opinion of Ghost, didn't spend enough time with it. For some reason when given too much GUI my curiosity dries up*

## And Now We're Here

So I put it down for a while. I had gone as far as hosting it with Netlify and pointing my domain to it. Ended up no longer needing th Digital Ocean droplet since Netlify only needed a github repo. *The Netlify move was made possible by setting up Hugo and Ghost on the Nginx server. There was some overlay and time needed before I realized I could do it all through Github*. Once again the lack of content was my reluctance. Not knowing what to write or even if I could write (will maybe evaluate upon later). Part of it was also not trying to understand it. Hugo is written in Go. I don't know Go. I know Bo. Not knowing Go was another deterrent. I had already gotten rid of Ghost as a CMS and moved to a Hugo template in futile attempts. 

And then I paused. Took a deep breath. Thought about what I wanted to do. I wanted to use GatsbyJS. Why? I can think of two reasons: 
 	1. Gatsby is in JS, which I think I know a little bit about. (Again see brief introduction)
 	2. Great Gatsby is an all time favorite

That's it, those are the reasons that I was going to lean on to drive me forward. So I started learning Gatsby. Went through the tutorials and decided to dive in. The initial issue was where to focus on my efforts: personal blog or sports blog. Yet another question of content. That toiling led to indecision on how to best set up the site, primarily which starter to use. So I thought about it, not quite as long as I normally do. I decided that if I can't get the personal blog up, then there is no way I can write content for a sports blog. And who knows if I combine them, maybe I become synonymous with all things sports(*subtle humor*).  

Back at it, trying to pick apart starters to see how Gatsby works. Being a Rick and Morty fan, I tested out the Chronoblog starter. Enjoyed the dark mode, but couldn't fully understand the set up. Mainly plugins and which ones were being used and where. Decided to make the switch to the Starter Blog by Kyle Mathews, why not. The set up, to me, was much cleaner to understand. less clutter since it's more basic the Chronoblog. Was able to make a few changes and am starting to understand the workflow. My latest attempt at the time of this post was a plugin installation that sort of works. 

## The Process

Wasn't too bad. Did it take me a long time? Sure. Am I an expert in anyting? Nope, I would conservatively say working knowledge and growing. The ability to throw up a site so quickly (essentially installing a starter) and then, with just enough knowledge of coding principles, make some edits is satisfying. It feels good to build something. Something tangible. My experiences led me to be introduced to the big picture. The border foe the puzzle and now I'm filling out the inside. And that's from a technical standpoint. 

From a personal view, a few variables in no particular order. 

* Learn: My main motivator. There's always something more to know, to understand. Akin to a forest, deep within a strong current rushing. The sound you hear are questions. The answer is the river.  
* Systemic: There's a system. If X then Y. Things flow and work. I like this. I want to understand this. Systems of Life.
* Creativity: Lacking. But this is my canvas.
* Experience: Where am I going? Who knows. If I want to write a post about pickles, I can write about pickles. 

That's it for now. I have my hammer and nail.
